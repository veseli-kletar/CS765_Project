Background
==========

Note that there are currently two algorithms implemented:

- Genetic algorithm
- Particle swam optimisation

Note that these two algorithms are not equally suited to each archetype. For
example the Genetic algorithm is believed to be better suited to discrete space
strategies such as the finite state machines whilst the Particle swarm algorithm
would be better suited to a continuous space strategy such as the Gambler.
